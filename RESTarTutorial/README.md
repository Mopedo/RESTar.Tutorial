# Tutorial Visual Studio Solution

This is the tutorial Visual Studio Solution. Just launch the .sln file from your local computer, and the project should load. All dependencies are added to the project's `package.config` file, so just building the solution should download all packages needed to run the application.

It was tested on Visual Studio 2017
